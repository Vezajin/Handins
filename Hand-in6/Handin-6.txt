** Assignment info:
   Mark one of the following boxes with an X

   [X] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, everything works as it
   should. In particular, here is the test client for vector
   operations (length, angle) that our code has passed:


   	public static void computeAngle() {
		int[] a = {2,1};
		int[] b =  {8,4};
		int[] c = {5,9};
		int[] d = {13,2};
		double d1 = dotProduct(a, b)/(length(a)*length(b));
		double d2 = dotProduct(c, b)/(length(c)*length(b));
		double d3 = dotProduct(c, d)/(length(c)*length(d));
		StdOut.println(d1); //Tested with calcualtor, results match
		StdOut.println(d2); //Tested with calcualtor, results match
		StdOut.println(d3); //Tested with calcualtor, results match
	}

   The dot product and length of vectors have been tested, and confirmed working. Though,
	it does seem a bit weird that humans are THAT far alike from some animals, such as deers. The values k = 20 and d = 10.000 were used.
	I tried using different values, but not really find any that made more sense than those, but I can see that K affects the results, which makes sense.
	For instance, with k = 8 lamprey is more similiar to humans than trout, which is the other way around at k = 20.
