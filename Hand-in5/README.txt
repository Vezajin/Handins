** Assignment info:
   Mark one of the following boxes with an X
   [X] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, everything works as it
   should. In particular, here is the test client that our code has
   passed:


   ... (insert some Java code here)

	No idea what to write here, but look in the .java file for anything code related.



   [ ] No, our solution does not work. (We will not get credit for this.)
   In particular, it sorts

   - Total hours to complete the assignment (optional): 3.5h


   RESULTS
   
   For each N, either complete the 7 lines (where it says ...) or
   remove the lines are write "Couldn't see a difference".

   N = 100:
   No cutoff: 
   mean running time: 1.50e-04 
   standard deviation: 3.68e-04
   
   With cutoff = 10
   mean running time: 1.60e-04
   standard deviation: 1.50e-03
   improvement in percent: 6%

   N = 1000:
   No cutoff: 
   mean running time: 2.10e-04 
   standard deviation: 3.02e-04
   
   With cutoff = 10
   mean running time: 1.10e-04
   standard deviation: 1.60e-03
   improvement in percent: 48%

   N = 10000:
   No cutoff: 
   mean running time: 1.08e-03
   standard deviation: 2.73e-04
   
   With cutoff = 10
   mean running time: 9.40e-04
   standard deviation: 3.74e-03
   improvement in percent: 13%

   N = 100000:
   No cutoff: 
   mean running time: 1.36e-02 
   standard deviation: 8.52e-04
   
   With cutoff = 10
   mean running time: 1.11e-02
   standard deviation: 7.13e-03
   improvement in percent: 19%

   N = 1000000:
   No cutoff: 
   mean running time: 1.72e-01 
   standard deviation: 1.35e-02
  
   With cutoff = 10
   mean running time: 1.41e-01

** Help
   List whatever help (if any) that you received, including help from
   TAs or fellow students. (Such help is allowed, but we want you to

** Comments
   List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on
   how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you
   enjoyed doing it. In particular, tell us how this exercise could be
   improved.
 
   As we can see there's an improvement with the cutoff, but at N=10000, we see a 
huge difference from the rest of the tests, this might be because I could have received
an email when running the program or something like that.
